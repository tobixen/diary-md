* I'd like a web interface (javascript?)
  * Searchable.  Have a look if there is anything that can be consolidated with the inventory-md project (could make another library md2json maybe for common code?)  I'm particularly thinking of an alias.json lile, allowing things like search in multiple languages.  Particularly place names, like Gothenburg vs Göteborg vs Gøteborg, and particularly place names like Царево vs Tsarevo vs Tzarevo vs Carevo.
  * Possibility to do the things that can be done through the CLI (find the set of unique 3rd level headers, filter to show diary with only one kind of 3rd level headers, count all expenses, +++).
  * Possibility to expand/collapse sections and subsections.  Like clicking on a top-level header it should be possible to easily collapse it to show nothing, or to show all but only the 2nd-level headers, etc.
  * Before implementing anything, look and see if there already exists software or libraries for this
